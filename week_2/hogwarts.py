# lists: lists are zero-indexed, meaning their posisiton counting starts from 0
students = ["Hermione", "Harry", "Ron"]

# printing an list item with its index
#  to access a list item, write list name and its index inside the square bracket
# print(students[0])

# we can print the list items using loops, isntead of printing them manually by assigning index individually
for student in students:
    print(student)
