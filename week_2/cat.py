# Week 2: Loops

# While Loop
# Print meow 3 times:
# print("meow")
# print("meow")
# print("meow")

# using while loop to execute the same code as above
print("While Loop:")
i = 3
while i != 0:
    print("meow")
    i -= 1 # earlier we wrote i = i - 1

# same code as above, just different logic
i = 0
while i < 3:
    print("meow")
    i += 1 # earlier we wrote i = i + 1
